Description:
    Creates a controller, routes and views for managing Active Fields,
    along with form inputs for Active Values and some useful helper methods.

    The code it generates is unlikely to be a perfect fit for your application.
    Youâ€™ll most probably want to customize the generated code.

Examples:
    `bin/rails generate active_fields:scaffold`
